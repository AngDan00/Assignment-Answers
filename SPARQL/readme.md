This repository contains a jupyter notebook with the answers to the following queries, using SPARQL:

Q1: 1 POINT  How many protein records are in UniProt? 

Q2: 1 POINT How many Arabidopsis thaliana protein records are in UniProt? 

Q3: 1 POINT retrieve pictures of Arabidopsis thaliana from UniProt? 

Q4: 1 POINT:  What is the description of the enzyme activity of UniProt Protein Q9SZZ8 

Q5: 1 POINT:  Retrieve the proteins ids, and date of submission, for 5 proteins that have been added to UniProt this year   (HINT Google for “SPARQL FILTER by date”)

Q6: 1 POINT How  many species are in the UniProt taxonomy?

Q7: 2 POINT  How many species have at least one protein record? (this might take a long time to execute, so do this one last!)

Q8: 3 points:  find the AGI codes and gene names for all Arabidopsis thaliana  proteins that have a protein function annotation description that mentions “pattern formation”

Q9: 4 POINTS:  what is the MetaNetX Reaction identifier (starts with “mnxr”) for the UniProt Protein uniprotkb:Q18A79

Q10: 5 POINTS:  What is the official locus name, and the MetaNetX Reaction identifier (mnxr…..) for the protein that has “glycine reductase” catalytic activity in Clostridium difficile (taxon 272563).   (this must be executed on the https://rdf.metanetx.org/sparql   endpoint)


## How to run?
1. Download the code as [README file for assignment answers](../README.md) indicates. 
2. Open the Jupyter NOtebook using the preferred interpreter
